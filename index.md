This site contains course materials for SISG Module 18: Computational Pipeline for WGS Data, July 26-28, 2023. **Course evaluations and certificates of completion will be available via the [official SISG course web page](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/institutes/sisg/SM2318)** (requires login).

- **Instructors:** Ken Rice, Laura Raffield, and Matthew Conomos
- **[Join the Slack Discussion](https://uwbiostatisticssisg.slack.com/archives/C05EAUXKLUT)**

## Course Format

#### Lectures
Course material will be presented through lectures. Slides for lectures are linked in the schedule below.

#### Exercises
Many of the lectures will be followed with hands-on exercises. Students are encouraged to work through the exercises together. Afterwards, the instructors will walk through the exercises and lead a discussion.

To run the exercises, log into [NHLBI BioData Catalyst powered by Seven Bridges](https://platform.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov) with your username and password -- we will use this platform for live demonstrations during the course.

- You will retain access to the Seven Bridges platform, including your SISG Project with all of the course materials even after the course ends. The SISG23 Workshop billing group will remain available to you for a short period of time, after which you will need to set up another payment method to run analyses. You can [request pilot cloud credits](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/resources/cloud-credits) ($500 worth) from BioData Catalyst. Additionally, there is guidance available for [writing BioData Catalyst cloud costs into your grant proposal budget](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/writing-biodata-catalyst-into-a-grant-proposal). 

All of the R code and data can also be downloaded from the [github repository](https://github.com/UW-GAC/SISG_2023) from which the site is built and run on your local machine.
